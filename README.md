# Project Description

## Buying

The Buying module starts at the home page where the user can search for a product by entering a term or browsing through various categories of products. It also allows the user to filter the search based on parameters like price, estimated delivery time etc. 

Next, the application displays all the products that match the userâ€™s criteria along with a brief description and price. The user can choose to buy or add the product to their Shopping Cart. The Shopping Cart feature allows the buyer to keep a track of all the items they wish to purchase. In addition, it also allows the user to remove or add new products to the list. The total price changes accordingly.

Final step is proceeding to the payment/transaction module.
