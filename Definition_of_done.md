# Definition of done 

Our project is considered complete when the website CryptoMart works without any technical flaws, meeting all the requirements of the user and seller. 
The user should be able to browse, create an account and shop.
The seller should be able to put up items for sale, manage their wallet.
The admin should be able to control the overall system and update it frequently. 

The final stage of the project: 

* Code is peer-reviewed

* Automated tests are created

* Code is deployed to test environment and all tests pass

* Code is well documented
