### Version Control
* Team members will work on feature branches until their story point is completed and ready to be merged into production (main branch)
* Merge conflicts will be solved using Visual Studio because itâ€™s a beauty for merge conflicts; all team members will be notified of a conflict and we shall agree on a solution
* Code must meet acceptance criteria, tested on multiple browsers in order to open PR.
* To merge code into main, a pull request will be made and the reviewers are the other two team members, BOTH reviewers must accept the pull request
* Pushing directly to main is a crime
