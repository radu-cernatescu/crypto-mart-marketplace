# Working Agreement

### Preferred form of contact and overall availability

* Slack for official communication
* Discord for miscellaneous communication


### Meeting schedules
* weekly meetings take place every wednesday to discuss sprint goals 
* at the beginning of the meeting we will have a ‘stand-up’ where team members can say what they’ve worked on, what they will be working on and if they have any blockers.
* conduct SCRUM [pokering](https://www.scrumpoker-online.org/) to estimate velocity, that way we know how many story points we can complete in a sprint


### Programming practices to be adopted
* Automated tests should be written BEFORE implementing the story
* Comment code that is not trivial so the team doesn’t have to decipher it
* Allow adequate time for regression testing
* Don’t let more stuff creep into a story than defined in the acceptance criteria
* Never ignore anything (i.e. bugs fixing themselves)
* No global variables
* Declarations at the beginning of each script/function (make sure they are initialized)
* Use === instead of ==
* Treat primitive values as such, not as Objects
* No eval() or other functions that allow arbitrary code execution!

Failure to follow any of the above will result in your pull request collecting dust until the issue is cured.

### Version Control
* Team members will work on feature branches until their story point is completed and ready to be merged into production (main branch)
* Merge conflicts will be solved using Visual Studio because it’s a beauty for merge conflicts; all team members will be notified of a conflict and we shall agree on a solution
* To merge code into main, a pull request will be made and the reviewers are the other two team members, BOTH reviewers must accept the pull request
* Code must meet acceptance criteria, tested on multiple browsers
* Pushing directly to main is a crime
* If possible, please [sign commits](https://docs.github.com/en/authentication/managing-commit-signature-verification) with a verified GPG key, that way we know your dog hasn’t pushed something without you knowing


## Guidelines

1. Meetings
* Be on time, end on time
* Have an agenda
* Respect team members’ time

2. Contributions
* Everyone has an equal voice and valuable contributions
* We debate the merit of ideas not people

3. Be transparent
* No hidden agendas, be truthful
* Constructive feedback will be given by team members and we will act on it.

4. Blockers
* Solve roadblocks within the team
* Make them known to the team as soon as possible, to allow for workarounds
* It is better to help get an existing story to “done” than to start another story that can’t be completed within the timeframe of the sprint


## Disciplinary 

### What to do when a member misses a meeting

* If a team member misses a meeting for a good reason, they shall participate in stand-up by sending a message in Slack with their updates

* Repeated absences will be reported to the Scrum Master
